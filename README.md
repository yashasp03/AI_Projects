## Maze Solver Using Greedy Best-First Search

The maze is represented as a grid where each cell can either be open (traversable) or closed (blocked). The objective is to find the shortest path from the starting point to the ending point using the Greedy Best-First Search algorithm.


## Key Features

- **Maze Representation**: A grid where open cells can be traversed and closed cells cannot.
- **Algorithm**: Greedy Best-First Search is used to find the path from the start to the target point.
- **Heuristic Function**: The algorithm uses a heuristic to choose the next cell, typically the Manhattan distance from the current cell to the target cell.


##Features
Implements Greedy Best-First Search to solve the maze problem.
Utilizes Manhattan distance as the heuristic function.
Computes and displays the path from the start point to the target point.
Displays the total moves and path cost.
