## Project Risk Assessment

This project focuses on utilizing fuzzy systems to assess project risks across various domains, with a particular emphasis on funding and staffing provided by the company. By employing fuzzy logic, the project aims to provide a nuanced understanding of project risk based on the adequacy of funding and the size of staffing.

The assessment of project risk is guided by specific rules:

If project funding is deemed adequate or project staffing is small, the risk is considered low.
If project funding is marginal and project staffing is large, the risk is categorized as normal.
If project funding is inadequate, the risk is assessed as high.
The assessment is conducted with funding contributing 35% and staffing 60% towards the overall risk evaluation. For instance, computing the risk for funding of 35% and staffing of 60% yields a project risk of 66.66% with a membership function of 0.5.


## Implimentation

The graphical representation of the project provides a clear visualization of how funding and staffing levels influence project risk, aiding stakeholders in making informed decisions regarding project management and resource allocation.

Implementation of the project involves constructing a fuzzy logic system that incorporates linguistic variables for funding, staffing, and risk. By defining appropriate membership functions and fuzzy rules, the system effectively assesses project risk based on the input parameters provided.

## Features

Utilization of fuzzy logic for nuanced risk assessment.
Graphical representation of risk based on funding and staffing levels.
Flexible and customizable assessment parameters to adapt to various project contexts.
Through this project, stakeholders can gain valuable insights into project risk factors and make proactive decisions to mitigate potential challenges and optimize project outcomes.
