## Image Segmentation

Image segmentation involves dividing an image into meaningful regions based on shared visual characteristics such as color, texture, or intensity. This project utilizes pre-built models to classify regions of similar pixels, a critical task with applications in medical imaging, object recognition, image and video compression, automated driving, and more.


## Key Points

Problem Description: The goal is to segment images into distinct regions that share common visual features using pre-built models.

Techniques Used: Utilizes instance segmentation to differentiate between different instances of the same category.

Segmentation Methods: Includes color-based, texture-based, grayscale-based, and region growing techniques.

Instance Segmentation: Distinguishes between different instances of the same category, providing detailed segmentation for each instance.


## Result Analysis

Outputs segmented images showing distinct regions for each identified instance category.
