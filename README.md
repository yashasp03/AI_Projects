## Object Recognition Using YOLO

Object recognition involves identifying and classifying different objects within images or videos. This project uses the YOLO (You Only Look Once) model for object detection, a popular AI application employed in various domains such as content tagging on social media, autonomous vehicles, and more.


## Key Points

Data Preparation: Preprocesses images by resizing them to match the model's input size and normalizing pixel values.
Model Acquisition: Utilizes pre-trained YOLO model files, including .cfg (configuration), .weights (pre-trained weights), and .txt (class labels).
Object Detection: Employs the YOLO model to detect objects within preprocessed images.
Evaluation: Outputs bounding boxes, class labels, and confidence scores for detected objects.
Post-processing: Filters out low-confidence detections and applies non-maximum suppression (NMS) to refine bounding boxes.
Visualization: Annotates the input image with bounding boxes, class labels, and confidence scores.
